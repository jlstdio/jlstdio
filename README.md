# 😎 About Me
I am passionate about bringing powerful and responsible intelligence to edge devices.

Pursuing Master's degree in Integrated Technology @ Yonsei Univ

## "Proactive Technology"

**_What I want to make with technology is something that understands the world better and providing right help._**

## research interest

My research interest is mainly mobile computing.

To make the dream possible I'm working on these kinds of topics.

**Point of view in understanding the world**
- efficient & realtime LLM inference on mobile devices & robots
- Surroundings & Human Context Understanding via Sensing
  
**Point of view in teaching the model in ethic way**
- Federated Learning
